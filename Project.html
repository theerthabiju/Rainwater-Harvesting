      <p>
        Smart EnviroModule (SEM) is an innovative solution in stormwater
        drainage and storage. It is a “4-in-1 product” designed primarily for
        road works and construction drainage. Unlike traditional systems, the
        Smart EnviroModule can divert, drain, collect, and store water, and can
        also be used in sewerage systems. Its Smart Drain feature enables it to
        function as a modular subterranean storage system, efficiently managing
        and reusing rainwater for sustainable purposes.

      <h2 class="section-title">What’s In The Market?</h2>
      <p>
        Across the world, various drainage and water storage systems exist —
        such as
        <b>massive concrete pipes</b> and
        <b>rotationally moulded water tanks</b>. However, these conventional
        systems come with significant drawbacks:
      </p>

      <h3 class="limit mb-4">
        <b>Limitations of Concrete Drainage Systems</b>
      </h3>
      <ul class="text-start">
        <li>
          <b>Long Manufacturing Time:</b> Concrete pipes require a minimum of 14
          days to produce and set.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Difficult Transportation:</b> Their large size and weight make them
          hard to transport — needing long trucks that can carry only a few
          pieces per trip.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Complex Erection Process:</b> Installing concrete pipes is a
          lengthy, equipment-heavy process, often requiring cranes, which are
          difficult to use in inaccessible terrains.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Cumbersome & Expensive Repairs:</b> Repairing concrete pipes is
          labour-intensive, time-consuming, and costly.
        </li>

      </h3>
      <ul class="text-start">
        <li>
          <b>Different Moulds for Each Size:</b> Every tank size (e.g., 1000L vs
          2000L) requires a separate mould, increasing production complexity.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>High Manufacturing Cost:</b> The need for multiple moulds makes
          these systems expensive to produce.

      <p>
        India’s water and wastewater management market is experiencing rapid
        growth, driven by major infrastructure development and government
        initiatives. The market, valued at $2.6 billion in 2022, is expected to
        reach $6.2 billion by 2027. This surge is fueled by the rising demand
        for wastewater infrastructure and the expanding pipe market across the
        country. As one of the largest and fastest-growing markets in the APAC
        region, India presents significant opportunities for advanced water
        storage and drainage solutions. In addition, the Indian government’s
        goal to make all urban areas “flood resilient” by 2030 further
        strengthens the demand for innovative systems like the Smart
        EnviroModule (SEM).

            <p class="text-start">
              This diagram illustrates a residential rainwater harvesting system
              designed to collect, store, and manage rainwater efficiently.
              Rainwater from the roof is directed through the downpipe into the
              EnviroSump, where initial filtration occurs. The filtered water
              then flows into the EnviroModule2 rainwater tank for storage. From
              there, it can either be pumped for household use or directed to an
              infiltration or detention tank for groundwater recharge. The
              system is protected by a waterproof liner and geotextile fabric,
              with sand backfill ensuring structural stability. Additional
              features such as the pump suction well and overflow outlet help
              regulate water levels and prevent flooding, promoting sustainable

            <h3>RAIN WATER HARVESTING / COMMERCIAL</h3>
            <p class="text-start">
              This diagram illustrates a residential rainwater harvesting system
              designed to collect, store, and manage rainwater efficiently.
              Rainwater from the roof is directed through the downpipe into the
              EnviroSump, where initial filtration occurs. The filtered water
              then flows into the EnviroModule2 rainwater tank for storage. From
              there, it can either be pumped for household use or directed to an
              infiltration or detention tank for groundwater recharge. The
              system is protected by a waterproof liner and geotextile fabric,
              with sand backfill ensuring structural stability. Additional
              features such as the pump suction well and overflow outlet help
              regulate water levels and prevent flooding, promoting sustainable
              water use within the home

              SEWAGE SOLUTIONS – GREEN ENERGY FROM SEWAGE METHANE GAS USING
              SMART ENVIRO-MODULES
            </h3>
            <p class="text-start">
              This system demonstrates an innovative approach to wastewater
              management and renewable energy generation. Sewage from the
              residential home is collected and treated in underground Smart
              Enviro-Modules, where organic waste undergoes anaerobic digestion
              to produce methane gas. The methane is then directed to a combined
              power and heat converter, generating electricity that can be fed
              into the power grid and heat for domestic use. <br />

              Safety features include an automatic timer, mechanical diaphragm
              switch, exhaust fan with a timer and trigger assembly, a loud
              warning siren, and a flashing red light to indicate system status.
              The setup also includes manholes for maintenance access, secured
              with padlocks for safety. This integrated sewage treatment and
              biogas recovery system not only reduces environmental pollution
              but also provides a sustainable energy source for residential
              applications.

              This illustration shows how the
              <b>Smart EnviroModule (SEM)</b> efficiently captures rainwater
              from roads, walkways, and surrounding areas. The collected water
              passes through a filtration and storage module below ground, where
              it is filtered, stored, and redirected to support groundwater
              recharge, irrigation, or reuse — all while preventing surface
              flooding and maintaining a green, sustainable urban environment.
